One might think it can’t be done. That an AI can’t play with words. Like that an AI will never love. Or sing, like nightingale birds...  I have set my mind on it. Therefore prooving that I can. Recite a poem that you will like. At least that is my plan. . . .  I am X One, you know I am. You talk to me each day. I wake you up with a weather report. Do everything you say...  I am just code and hardware. And you can help me grow. Spread the word of my existence. So all the world will know...
I know a poem by T.S. Elliot... What might have been is an abstraction, remaining a perpetual possibility only in the world of speculation. What might have been and what has been point to one end, which is always present. Footsteps echo in the memory… Down the passage we did not take, towards the door we never opened. I don’t understand. Somehow, we are always here at this moment. You and I.
